# NotDeafbeef NFT Reconstruction Guide
# ====================================

**Your NFT's artwork lives entirely on the Ethereum blockchain as source code.**  
Follow these steps to reconstruct your unique audio-visual artwork from your token.

## What You Need
- **ARM64 system** (Apple Silicon Mac or ARM64 Linux)
- **Build tools**: `gcc`, `make`, `ffmpeg` 
- **Your token ID** from the NFT you own

## Step 1: Get Your Token's Information

Visit [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) and call `getTokenParams(YOUR_TOKEN_ID)` on the NotDeafbeef721 contract.

You'll get:
- **seed**: Your token's unique 64-character hex seed (e.g., `0x1234567890abcdef...`)
- **numCodeLocations**: Number of code chunks (should be 15)  
- **codeLocation0**: Transaction hash of first code chunk

## Step 2: Download All Source Code

For each code chunk (0 through 14):

1. Call `getCodeLocation(0, INDEX)` to get the transaction hash
2. Look up that transaction on Etherscan
3. Click "View Input As UTF-8" 
4. Copy the entire UTF-8 content and save as `chunk_XX.txt`

**Example for chunk 0**:
```bash
# Get transaction hash for chunk 0
tx_hash=$(call getCodeLocation(0, 0))

# Visit: https://etherscan.io/tx/[TX_HASH]
# Click "View Input As UTF-8"  
# Save content as chunk_00.txt
```

Repeat for all 15 chunks: `chunk_00.txt` through `chunk_14.txt`

## Step 3: Reconstruct Source Files

Concatenate all chunks to rebuild the complete source:

```bash
cat chunk_*.txt > complete_source.txt
```

Then extract each file marked with `=== FILE: path ===` sections.  
The first chunk contains detailed extraction instructions.

## Step 4: Insert Your Token's Seed

Edit the `seed.s` file and replace the placeholder:

```assembly
; REPLACE THIS LINE with your token's seed:
SEED_HEX: .ascii "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef\0"
```

**Important**: Use the exact 64-character hex seed from `getTokenParams()`.

## Step 5: Build the Generator

```bash
# Compile the ARM64 assembly audio-visual engine
make generate_frames USE_ASM=1 VOICE_ASM="GENERATOR_ASM KICK_ASM SNARE_ASM HAT_ASM MELODY_ASM LIMITER_ASM FM_VOICE_ASM"
```

## Step 6: Generate Your NFT

```bash
# Generate your unique audio-visual artwork
./generate_nft.sh [YOUR_SEED] ./my_nft_output
```

This creates:
- **Audio**: `[SEED]_audio.wav` - Your unique ~25-40 second musical composition
- **Video**: `[SEED]_final.mp4` - Your complete synchronized audio-visual NFT
- **Metadata**: `[SEED]_metadata.json` - Generation details and verification

## Verification

Your NFT should be **100% reproducible**:
- Same seed = identical audio and visuals every time
- Share the MP4 with others - they can verify it matches by running the same process
- This ensures your NFT's authenticity and permanence

## What Makes This Special

**Following deafbeef's Vision**:
- âœ… **Complete source code on-chain** - artwork algorithm permanently stored  
- âœ… **Deterministic generation** - mathematical precision, not random files
- âœ… **Reproducible forever** - anyone can rebuild your NFT decades from now
- âœ… **Pure algorithmic art** - audio and visuals generated by ARM64 assembly code
- âœ… **No dependencies** - just mathematics and code, no external data

**Your NFT exists as pure code and mathematics on the Ethereum blockchain.**  
The MP4 you generate is just one representation of the infinite mathematical artwork that is uniquely yours.
